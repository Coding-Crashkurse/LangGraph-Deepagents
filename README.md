# Deep Research Agents Examples

Minimal examples showing how to use `deepagents` with LangChain:
- Simple chat with a helpful assistant.
- Structured planning without delegating to sub-agents.
- Delegation to a custom math sub-agent.

## Setup
1. Install dependencies with uv: `uv sync`
2. Add your API keys to `.env` (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY=...`).

## Run
Execute `python main.py` to run all three examples sequentially.
